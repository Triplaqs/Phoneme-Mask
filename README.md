# Phoneme-Mask
Animating a Mask with different phonemes forms. 

### Here a sample of the animation (Phoneme A):
![Animation](./results/neutral_to_a.gif)

### Here the current mask displayed:
![Neutral Face](./results/neutral_face.png)

### Speaking to user input:
I had to choose a way to translate texts into phonemes, so I chose French pronounciation.
![Translation](./results/translate.png)

### Results:
Here are examples of sentences red by the mask !
![Speaking1](./results/speaking1.gif)
![Speaking2](./results/speaking2.gif)
![Speaking3](./results/speaking3.gif)

### Better interaction with the user:
Using ImGui I added a window to get the user input directly in the window.
